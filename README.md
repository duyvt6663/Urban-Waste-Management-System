# Urban-Waste-Management-System
Urban waste collection aid
This projects creates a web-based dashboard view for managers of an automated waste-collection system.  
It employs the MVC model:
* The Model is logics implemented in a MySQL database with functional features including authentication and data calibration.
* The Controller acts as intermediate between the database and the front-end. It necessitates communication using an API. It's also where the route-allocation 
task is handled. We employ Travelling Salesman Heuristics for the job. 
* The View is where the dashboard is implemented. It includes map management, schedule management and employee management modules.
